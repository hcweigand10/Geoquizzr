# description

This is an online quiz with 22 geography questions. Players are given 4 options for each question and are scored based on how much time is left on the clock after the final question, with wrong answers dedducting time. Players can then submit their initials to have their score saved locally and ranked. 

The repo contains 3 html files, one being my index, another being the game page itself, and the final being the highscores page. I used local storage to store and pull highscores and primarily javascript to run the quiz.
